VIDEO DEMONSTRATION SCRIPT !!!

HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW:

1. ER Model:
Briefly show your ER diagram and explain the key entities and relationships. Mention any
assumptions made during design.

2. ER to Relational Mapping:
Explain how your ER model was translated into relational tables. If using ORM, this means showing
how entities and relationships are mapped using classes, annotations, or decorators.

3. Database Definition:
If using ORM:
You are not required to submit DDL or DML files. Instead, you must:
- Show the entity class definitions (e.g., Member.java, Session.cs, Class.py)
- Explain how these classes are used to create and populate tables
- Demonstrate how table creation, insertion, and queries are done via the ORM (not via raw
SQL)

4. Functionality Demonstration:
Walk through all the operations you have implemented (based on your group size). For each:
- State the user role (Member, Trainer, Admin)
- Show how the feature works in the application
- Include both a success case and at least one failure or edge case
- Show the corresponding backend logic:
- If using SQL directly: show the SQL statement being executed
- If using ORM: show the Python/Java/C#/etc. code that performs the database operation

5. Code Structure:
Give a quick overview of how your code is organized. Highlight key files (e.g., database connection).

6. Interface & User Flow:
Demonstrate how different users interact with the system (e.g., login flow, navigation across
member/admin views), even if simple or CLI-based.
